## ü§ì Introduction
A simple bash script to speed up and simplify the deployment of WireGuard Road Warriors (mobile VPN clients) against a MikroTik firewall running RouterOS.

The script will produce both the RouterOS configuration required as well as a QR code to scan with the WireGuard mobile app. This will enable you to deploy a new mobile VPN client within a minute or two, and you don't have to send public keys back and forth between the mobile device and the router.

## üïπ Demo Applications
### Demo 1: Example Output
Here is a small command-line demo showing the WireGuard Tunnel Generator script in action.

![CLI Demo](docs/img/wireguard-tunnel-generator-demo.gif)

## üíª Installation
Download the script from GitHub and place in inside your home directory.

The script needs three packages in order to operate smoothly:
```
sudo apt install ipcalc-ng wireguard-tools qrencode
```

1. `ipcalc-ng` is used to validate IP adress input.
2. `wireguard-tools` is used to generate private/public key pair.
3. `qrencode` is used to encode the WireGuard configuration into a QR code.

>The script has only been tested on Debian but might work on other operating systems as well.

## üìö Basics
### Parameters
The script accepts parameters which you use to define the WireGuard configuration for each client deployed:
```bash
Usage:
  ./wg-tunnel-generator.sh [options] <mobile_peer_ip>

Options:
  <mobile_peer_ip>    Mobile peer IP address in CIDR notation, ie. 10.0.0.2/32
  -a <subnet,...>     One or more IP subnet(s) to be routed through the tunnel
  -d <dns,...>        One or more DNS server(s) to be used by the mobile client
  -e <host[:port]>    WireGuard endpoint on the firewall, ie. fw.example.com:13231
  -h                  Print this help and exit
  -n <name>           Descriptive name for the mobile client
  -p <public_key>     Public key of the WireGuard interface on the firewall
  -v                  Print verbose debugging information
```
The only parameter required is `<mobile_peer_ip>`, which is the IP address to be assigned to the client; all other parameters (options) have default values that will be used if not provided by your when running the script. *But, these are simply testing values that you will want to override.*

Example:
```bash
./wg-tunnel-generator.sh -n my-phone -a 10.50.0.0/16 -d 1.1.1.1,8.8.8.8 -e vpn.example.com:13231 -p "fb4r8zxzstQ+/GxULwnqW9mqDF3YrBT2SvcEHyXqoWM=" 10.50.50.2/32
```

### Change the Defaults
The default option values above can be modified simply by editing `wg-tunnel-generator.sh`. This can be handy if you don't want to pass parameters every time you need to deploy a new road warrior.

```bash
# Pre-defined parameter values
ALLOWED_IPS="0.0.0.0/0"
DNS="1.0.0.1,1.1.1.1"
ENDPOINT="fw.example.com:13231"
FW_PRIVATE_KEY="0"
FW_PUBLIC_KEY="0"
IP_ADDR=""
NAME="mobile-phone"
VERBOSE=false
```

### Some more stuff
The...

## üíæ Running the Script
One thing to keep in mind when running the script is whether a **WireGuard Interface** has been configured on the router. This is important because the interface only need to be created once. It's during the interface creation that a private/public key pair is generated.

When the interface is already configured you need to get the public key from the configuration in RouterOS.

WinBox:
- Go to WireGuard and open `wg_mobile` in the WireGuard tab.

Terminal:
- Run `:put ([/interface/wireguard/get wg_mobile ]->"public-key")`.

>Assuming the name of the WireGuard interface is `wg_mobile`.

### Device Information
To get the general device information we just call the `get_info()` method.

```python
info = meter.get_info()
```
Access the values via the class properties:
```python
info.id                         # Returns the device ID        : '01ab:0200:00cd:03ef'  (for example).
info.manufacturer               # Returns the manufacturer     : 'NET2GRID'
info.model                      # Returns the model            : 'SBWF4602'
info.firmware                   # Returns the firmware version : '1.7.14'
info.hardware                   # Returns the hardware version : 1
info.batch                      # Returns the batch number     : 'HMX-P0D-123456'
```
### Power Readings
To get the power readings we call the `get_electricity()` method. These readings are a bit more complex since the information gathered from the Elna device is divided in to sub-classes, but it's not that complicated:

```python
electricity = meter.get_electricity()
```

#### Now
Get the **current** power consumption:
```python
electricity.now.key             # Returns the string  : 'now'
electricity.now.value           # Returns the power   : 453  (for example).
electricity.now.unit            # Returns the unit    : 'W'  (as in Watt)
electricity.now.timestamp       # Returns a timestamp : '2022-12-24 13:37:00'
```

#### Minimum
Get the **minimum** power consumption in the period:
```python
electricity.minimum.key         # Returns the string  : 'minimum'
electricity.minimum.value       # Returns the power   : 202  (for example).
electricity.minimum.unit        # Returns the unit    : 'W'  (as in Watt)
electricity.minimum.timestamp   # Returns a timestamp : '2022-12-13 13:37:00'
```

#### Maximum
Get the **maximum** power consumption in the period:
```python
electricity.maximum.key         # Returns the string  : 'maximum'
electricity.maximum.value       # Returns the power   : 14320  (for example).
electricity.maximum.unit        # Returns the unit    : 'W'  (as in Watt)
electricity.maximum.timestamp   # Returns a timestamp : '2022-12-31 13:37:00'
```
> The time frame (period) of which the **minimum** and **maximum** values has been recorded is unknown (to me).

#### Imported
Get the **imported** power. This would be total power coming **into** the household:
```python
electricity.imported.key         # Returns the string  : 'imported'
electricity.imported.value       # Returns the power   : 12345678  (for example).
electricity.imported.unit        # Returns the unit    : 'Wh'  (as in Watt hours)
electricity.imported.timestamp   # Returns a timestamp : '2022-12-31 13:37:00'
```

#### Exported
Get the **exported** power. This would be total power coming **out of** the household:
```python
electricity.exported.key         # Returns the string  : 'exported'
electricity.exported.value       # Returns the power   : 87654321  (for example).
electricity.exported.unit        # Returns the unit    : 'Wh'  (as in Watt hours)
electricity.exported.timestamp   # Returns a timestamp : '2022-12-31 13:37:00'
```

### WLAN Information
We can also get the WLAN information of the device by calling the `get_wlan_info()` method. The device can act as both a Wireless Client (Station) and an Access Point (AP) depending on if it has been connected to you WiFi network or not.

```python
wlan = meter.get_wlan_info()
```

Access the WLAN information via the class properties of the object:
```python
wlan.mode           # Returns the current WLAN mode
wlan.ap_ssid        # Returns the Access Point SSID
wlan.ap_key         # Returns the Access Point Password
wlan.client_ssid    # Returns the SSID of the AP Elna is connected to
wlan.join_status    # Returns the number of clients joined to the Elna AP
wlan.mac            # Returns the MAC address currently in use
wlan.ip             # Returns the IP address
wlan.subnet         # Returns the Subnet mask
wlan.gateway        # Returns the Default gateway
wlan.dns            # Returns the Primary DNS server
wlan.dnsalt         # Returns the Secondary DNS server
wlan.n2g_id         # Returns the Net2Grid ID number
wlan.sta_mac        # Returns the MAC address of the WLAN Station
wlan.ap_mac         # Returns the MAC address of the Access Point
wlan.eth_mac        # Returns the Ethernet MAC address (?)
```
> Note: The descriptions following the WLAN properties above are estimated guesses.
